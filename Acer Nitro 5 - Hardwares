Device: Acer Nitro 5 - AN517-54


Touchpad
Problem: The touchpad works in delay sometimes and there is no specific known occasion for that to happen.
Noted occasion is, when The charger is connected, It acts in delay, or once the charge becomes full, it acts in delay.
Reason: Possibly over-power supply for the touchpad could cause this issue.
Solution:
• If a delay occurs during the laptop’s running on battery, Turn off the touchpad and turn it on again (Fn + F2 for my laptop)
• If a delay occurs during the laptop’s running while charging, Try Turning off and turning on the touchpad. If continues, Try putting the fans on full speed - Using NitroSense and during that, Turn off and turn on the Touchpad. Not checked fully, for how long this will work.
• If the charging is full, it will act with the same delay. Try the second step. It didn't work for me except for the first minute, and then the delay continued. So, Remove the charger once the laptop is fully charged.
